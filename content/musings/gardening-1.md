Although the garden is looking great, I recently discovered a sinister pest called the squash vine borer. The black and orange moth lands on gourds, lays its eggs, and the resulting larva bore through well established vines and kill the plant. I've been systematically excising them from pumpkins and zucchini with tweezers but it's a losing battle.
