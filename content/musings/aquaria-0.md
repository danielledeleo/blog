I recently sold the two aquariums I've had for the last year and a bit and replaced them with a bigger, nicer one. I'm going all out with CO2, tons of tricky plants, great natural decor, and maybe even discus! For now, I have a handful of [corydoras panda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Corydoras_panda) swimming around a giant tank. Quick aside, I hope the ones I bought were tank-bred, because they're a near-threatened species. That definitely makes me look at them a bit differently.
