I finally got around to updating this blog to the new domain name: `transpile.net`. It's a double entendre, get it? Follow me on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/transpile.net), which uses this root domain as the DID. Even though I haven't touched this blog since around this time last year, it was effortless to get it up and running with the latest version of Hugo and a switch to GitLab Pages. I have lots of ideas for writing and follow-ups, so check back.
