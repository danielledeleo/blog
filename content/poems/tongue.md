```
I crave a language
Only the faithful speak

I wish for words
Without judgement or authority

I picture prose
To say sometimes, not for sure

I feel a tongue
That dances whole on its own

I dream of a dialect
That neither stammers nor preaches

I long for letters
Like wet sand on beaches

I crave a language
Only the faithful speak
```
