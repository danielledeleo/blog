```
Wake yourself one day
Absolutely convinced
Of terrors so certain
Your whole body winced

Wade your way back
Determined but scared
The krakens uncurtained
So overprepared

Tie yourself knotted
Up tightly with string
Next time you fall
Unraveled you'll cling

Lie yourself naked
Back into the trap
Stripped of your all
Only then can you nap
```
