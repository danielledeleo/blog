Two months ago, I wrote about [desktop monitors](/posts/a-monitor-for-2025/). Since then, I've found something that pretty much meets my needs.

Let's see how it stacks up to my demands.

```
- 27-inch (16:9) or ultrawide equivalent
- 10-bit, glossy
- >= 160 ppi, (i.e., 4K or greater)
- 120Hz or 144Hz, more is overkill
- Better than average office display response times
- 400 nits BARE minimum, 600 nits (actual)
- Looks like a MacBook display side-by-side
- Not more expensive than a Studio Display
```

The monitor I found meets or exceeds all of these requirements.

- 27" 4K IPS miniLED
- 10-bit (8-bit+FRC)
- 160Hz (120Hz over USB-C, 144Hz over DP-to-USB-C on my M1 MacBook Pro)
- Good response times
- *Extremely* bright to the point where I don't keep have it at 100% brightness, a first for me.
- Slightly more saturated colours than a MacBook display, which is fine. My problem is with less vibrant displays.
- I paid CAD$700 for it with an Amazon discount coupon
- USB KVM
- **Not glossy :^(**

# INNOCN M27V

[Link](https://innocn.com/products/innocn-27-4k-mini-led-monitor-27m2v). It's pretty ugly with its thick, cheap silver plastic constructionâ€”and it's the best desktop monitor for my needs on the market today. If it came with a glossy finish, I'd have no complaints. I intend to get a second one and write a full review in a few months. I'm very pleased so far. The OSD is okay.

These monitors are pretty hard to get. In Canada, my only option was a cross-border order shipped from an Amazon.com warehouse. I will likely have to rely on Amazon for any warranty service, which makes me pretty uneasy given my miserable experiences with Eve/Dough.

I will not miss my Eve Spectrum. If anyone wants a cheap, flaky, beautiful monitor for a very low price and happens to live in Ottawa, please let me know.
